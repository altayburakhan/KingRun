***A game where I combined Runner and merge system.***

### Runner Phase ###
- The king we control starts to collect class types along the run.
- In the meantime, he has to reach the end without hitting the obstacles.
- I did this phase in about 10 days.
- I have only made 2 levels yet, these levels were made so that the player can know the game and understand the mechanics.

## Merge(Battle) Phase ##
- After the runner phase is over, the camera focuses on an area(Battlefield).
- At this stage, we need to place the minions collected during the run on the field and beat the enemy.
- You can combine minions to turn them into a more powerful minion.
- I did this phase in about 23 days.
- The animations are not smooth as i haven't started yet.
